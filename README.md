The USAF Digital DATCOM allows a user to model an aircraft in order to analyze the stability and
control of aircraft at different angles of attack and flight regimes. The details of creating this model
can be found in the USAF Digital DATCOM Volume I.

The process of creating a model in Digital DATCOM is somewhat tedious and how the components
of the aircraft are put together can be a mystery. This program is useful in order to quickly check
and debug the configuration and ensure the model is created correctly. Obviously, an inaccurate
model can lead to inaccurate results from Digital DATCOM.
